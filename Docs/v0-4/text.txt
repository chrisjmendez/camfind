1) I've given anton.kovalyov@idapgroup.com & client.team@idapgroup.com access to
 to a new crashlytics account. If you have any problems getting that to work, please let me know.

2) I've added artem.chabanniy@gmail.com & trimmurrti@gmail.com accesss to Google iOS Tag Manager. I will need your help configuring the tracking.  Here are the things I would like to track. 

https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/ios/
• How long do users spend on the app (duration time)?

• How frequently do users return to the app (# of repeated users every day)?

• How many requests are sent to CamFind ( # POST requests sent every day to camfind)?

• What are the descriptions that are returned from /image_responses/<token>
For example: 
"description": "black sun glasses"
"description": "white t-shirt"

• What is the location of the users taking photos of the app (latitude + longitude)?

3) The app looks pretty damn good!  Congrats!  I do have a few design tweaks so see the attachments. 

3.a) See "done.png".  When a user is typing inside of the search box and press "done" on the keyboard, it should submit the  search query. 

3.b) I added some instructions to search.  

3.c) I also added some updates to uiwebview.
