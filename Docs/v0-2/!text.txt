I absolutely love how you guys made the search results listing look.  All I ask is that when a user taps (onTap Event) on a specific item, we take them to a UIWebView where we show them their product page. 

Each item from the YQL has an anchor tag like this: 

"a": { "href": "/products/ocean-zebra-wood-aviator-sunglasses” }

all we need to do is load the UIWebView with this URL:

http://impctful.com/products/ocean-zebra-wood-aviator-sunglasses

No "ShopifyCamFind" or "Shopify" anything. Let's call the app, CamFind.

Package Name:

1) Instead of sending a 640x960 or 640x1136 photo to mashape, can you POST something smaller to their API? Maybe 320x480 image?  I think it will speed up the app.

It possible, will do. We will proportionally resize it.

2) Every time a user takes a new picture, can we please save it to their camera roll?

No problems. Should we save resized image, or full size? Save automatically ?  Or by button pressed, for example ?

3) Can you also let users upload photos from their camera roll? 

Will do, please include this to wireframes.

4) I sill send a wireframe in a few hours.

Oh, it is great. Waiting… 

5) Can we install crashlytics? I can give you a username and password in a bit.

I think, we already have everything for adding it.
